The batch processing Architecture will consist of four components of microservirces which are ETL,Pre-Processing and processing microservices, Viasualization microservices and Machine learning area

under ETL, the words ETL stand for Extract Transfer and load so under this area the application show that the system will use this procedure for collecting data from the source and transfer them and loading the data into another microservices for the process and analysing of data, under this component 
the system will use python programming language for intergrating the systems
